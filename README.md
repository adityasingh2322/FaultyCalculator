# 🧮 Faulty Calculator

A fun twist on the regular calculator — this one **deliberately gives wrong answers 70% of the time** 😆.  
Built for practice and entertainment, it also includes keyboard interaction and some playful error handling.

## ✨ Features
- ❌ **70% Wrong Answers** – the calculator intentionally miscalculates most of the time.
- ✅ **30% Correct Answers** – but sometimes, it works like a normal calculator.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Support**:
  - **Enter** → Calculate result  
  - **Backspace** → Delete the last character  
  - **Ctrl + Backspace** → Clear the entire input  
  - **Any Alphabet Key** → Triggers an alert (since only numbers/operators are allowed)
- 🖱️ **Clickable Buttons** for digits and operators.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Enter your expression using numbers and operators.
2. Press **Enter** or click **=** to calculate.
3. The calculator decides whether to show a **correct result** or a **faulty result** (70% chance wrong).
4. If you try pressing alphabet keys, it will pop up an **alert** reminding you it’s not valid input.
